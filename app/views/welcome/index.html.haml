      This is the Tuttle Demo application which demonstrates the
      capabilities of Tuttle.
    %p
      This application is a Rails 5.0 minimal application with a few
      gems (Devise, CanCan, Paperclip, etc) installed to show off
      their inspectors.

    %p= link_to 'Tuttle Dashboard Â»', tuttle.root_path, :class=>['btn','btn-primary','btn-lg'], :role=>'button'

.container
  .row
    .col-md-6
      .h2 Rails
      %p
        This basic Rails application consists of a few controllers and a few models hitting a PostgreSQL database.
      %p
        Tuttle can help inspect Rails applications with knowledge of configuration best practices.
        You can use Tuttle to inspect Models, Controllers, Helpers, Engines, Generators, and more.
      %p= link_to 'Tuttle Rails', tuttle.rails_path, :class=>['btn','btn-primary'], :role=>'button'
    .col-md-6
      %h2 ActiveSupport
      %p
        Tuttle can help inspect how ActiveSupport is configured, including Inflectors and Timezones.
      %p
        The inspector can also report on which dependencies have been loaded, autoloaded, and eager-loaded.
      %p
        = link_to 'Tuttle ActiveSupport', tuttle.active_support_path, :class=>['btn','btn-primary'], :role=>'button'

  .row

    .col-md-6
      .h2 Ruby
      %p
        Tuttle's Ruby inspector support allows you see how Ruby itself has been configured.
        You can get details into Garbage Collection, tuning parameters, and environment variables.
      %p
        Tuttle will also report on which files have been loaded by Kernel.
      %p
        = link_to 'Tuttle Ruby', tuttle.ruby_path, :class=>['btn','btn-primary'], :role=>'button'

        %li CanCan authorization with simple rules
